# Transaction Service V2

Back-end for saving personal transaction, including purchase and income. This is just a different version of other repos built using FastAPI (Python) framework. For this V2 I use Gin (Go) framework and relational database (MySQL).

This is for learning purpose, to keep my Go knowledge attached to my memory as it is a new language and a new framework for creating a REST API.
