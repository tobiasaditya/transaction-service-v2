# Transaction Service V2

Back-end for saving personal transaction, including purchase and income. This is just a different version of other repos built using FastAPI (Python) framework. For this V2 I use Gin (Go) framework and relational database (MySQL). Updated, change using no relational database, cause why not.

This is for learning purpose, to keep my Go knowledge attached to my memory as it is a new language and a new framework for creating a REST API.
